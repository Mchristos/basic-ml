Simple implementations of machine learning algorithms. 

Most implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms are written for efficiency. It's hard to find clear, well-commented code that implements them. This repo aims to be that. 

- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor 
- Radial Basis Function (RBF) regressor 

Inspired by scikit-learn: each class implements the sklearn api (e.g fit(), predict(), score() etc).
